# TasteShare: A Recipe and Cooking Community
**Author:** Minkyeong Kim, Hoopuiwa Perry

## Overview

**The Problem:** Finding recipes with customizable portions and connecting with other home cooks can be challenging for beginners and enthusiasts alike. TasteShare aims to address these issues with a simplified web application where users can adjust recipe portions and engage with a small community.

**The Solution:** TasteShare is a platform where users can browse recipes, adjust serving sizes, and share comments or tips with other users. As users contribute by posting comments and interacting with recipes, they can eventually unlock "Author" status, allowing them to share their own recipes.

## Key Features


**Recipe Conversion Tools**
- Portion Scaling: Adjust portions up or down easily. Users enter their desired servings, and the ingredient list scales automatically.
- Measurement Conversions: Convert between units like cups to grams, tablespoons to ounces, and other standard units (including metric to imperial and vice versa). This ensures accurate quantities for any recipe and supports international users.

**Recipe Categories**
- Recipes are organized into a few primary categories such as Italian, Korean, Filipino, and Baking for easy browsing.

**Community Engagement**
- Comment System: Users can comment on recipes to share tips or ask questions.
- Recipe Rating: A simple thumbs-up rating for each recipe to help identify popular options.

**User Profiles**
- Profile Page: Users can view their saved recipes and see their comment history.
- Friends List: Displays a list of friends, recent activities, and favorite recipes, allowing users to follow friends’ updates and recommendations.
- Author Status: Frequent contributors can unlock “Author” status, allowing them to submit their own recipes.

**Admin Features**
- Content Moderation: Admins can review recipes and comments for quality and compliance with community guidelines.
