## Overview

The Problem: Finding recipes with customizable portions and connecting with other home cooks can be challenging for beginners and enthusiasts alike. TasteShare aims to address these issues with a simplified web application where users can adjust recipe portions and engage with a small community.

The Solution: TasteShare is a platform where users can browse recipes, adjust serving sizes, and share comments or tips with other users. As users contribute by posting comments and interacting with recipes, they can eventually unlock "Author" status, allowing them to share their own recipes.

## Key Features

Recipe Customization

Adjustable Portions: Users can modify recipe quantities to fit their needs (limited to basic ingredient scaling).
Recipe Categories: Recipes are organized into a few primary categories such as Italian, Korean, Filipino, and Baking for easy browsing.
Community Engagement

Comment System: Users can comment on recipes to share tips or ask questions.
Recipe Rating: A simple thumbs-up rating for each recipe to help identify popular options.
User Profiles

Profile Page: Users can view their saved recipes and see their comment history.
Author Status: Frequent contributors can unlock “Author” status, allowing them to submit their own recipes.
Admin Features
