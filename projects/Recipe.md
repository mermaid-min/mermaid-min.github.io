## Overview
The Problem: For many home cooks, finding recipes in the right portions, connecting with like-minded food enthusiasts, and sharing one’s own culinary ideas can be challenging. TasteShare addresses these needs by offering a platform where users can easily adjust recipe portions, share their cooking experiences, and engage in culinary discussions. Additionally, frequent contributors can become recipe authors, fostering a collaborative space for everyone from casual cooks to dedicated foodies.
The Solution: TasteShare is a user-driven platform designed to provide an engaging, supportive cooking community. Users can access and customize recipes, share insights, ask questions, and contribute their own recipes over time. TasteShare makes cooking accessible by enabling portion adjustments, encouraging community discussions, and empowering users to become recipe authors as they engage more with the platform.

## Key Features
1. Recipe Customization and Scaling
Adjustable Portions: Users can select the desired portion size, and the platform will automatically adjust ingredient amounts.
Recipe Categories: Recipes are organized by cuisine (e.g., Italian, Korean, Filipino) and type (e.g., baking), making it easy for users to find dishes by category.
Nutritional Information: Display of nutritional values per portion, based on selected adjustments.
2. Community Engagement and User Contributions
Recipe Submission and Author Role: Frequent contributors who actively participate through posts and comments can gain “Author” status, allowing them to submit their own recipes.
Commenting and Rating System: Users can comment on recipes, rate them, and share their feedback to help others in the community.
Questions and Discussions: Users can post questions about recipes, cooking techniques, or ingredients, fostering real-time discussions and sharing.
3. Social Features and Notifications
Notifications: Users receive alerts for new recipes in their favorite categories, responses to their comments or questions, and updates from favorite authors.
Activity Feed: A feed showing recent comments, recipe uploads, and community discussions keeps users up to date on the latest trends and tips.
User Profiles: Members can create profiles to track their contributions, favorite recipes, and engagement history.
4. Dashboard and Reporting for Admins
Admin Panel for Recipe and User Management: Admins can oversee recipe submissions, moderate comments, and manage user roles.
Engagement Reports: Reports on community engagement (comments, likes, popular recipes) to help guide content focus.
Author Activity Monitoring: Track user activity to ensure only the most engaged contributors attain Author status.

## Approach
User Registration and Role-Based Access
Basic User Registration and Login: Users create accounts to save recipes, participate in discussions, and access customization features.
Author Status and Privileges: Highly active users gain additional privileges to post original recipes.
Admin Access: Allows for content moderation, recipe approval, and user management.
Recipe Search and Customization
Categorized Recipe Library: Recipes organized by cuisine (Italian, Korean, Filipino) and type (baking, grilling, etc.) for easy browsing.
Portion Adjustments: Users can adjust the number of servings for each recipe, with ingredient amounts recalculated accordingly.
Recipe Details Page: Each recipe includes instructions, nutritional information, and customizable portions.
Community Engagement and Notifications
Interactive Comments: Users can comment, ask questions, and discuss each recipe.
Push Notifications and Alerts: Notify users of new comments, recipe updates, or responses.
User Profiles: Users have profiles that showcase their contributions, favorite recipes, and follower count.
Analytics and Insights for Admins
Dashboard: Displays popular recipes, active users, and engagement trends.
Engagement Tracking: Track community activity to reward contributors and highlight popular content.
Content Moderation: Admin controls for approving, flagging, or removing inappropriate content.

## Use Case Scenarios
Recipe Browsing and Portion Adjustment: A user searches for a pasta recipe, selects the portion size, and follows the automatically adjusted ingredient amounts.
Community Question and Answer: A member posts a question about substituting ingredients in a recipe, and other users or the recipe author respond with suggestions.
Becoming an Author: After regularly commenting and sharing tips, a user gains Author status, enabling them to post a family recipe for a popular Filipino dish.
Admin Recipe Approval: An admin reviews a newly submitted recipe for clarity and appropriateness before making it live on the site.
Notifications and Updates: A user receives notifications when a favorite recipe category, such as baking, has new recipes posted.

## Beyond the ideas
After implementing the core functionality, TasteShare could expand with the following features:
Email and SMS Notifications for updates on popular recipes, new responses, and user mentions.
Recipe Video Tutorials where authors can add short videos to accompany recipe instructions.
Advanced Search Filters for dietary preferences, cooking time, and difficulty level.
Ingredient Barcode Scanning to quickly add items to a shopping list or adjust recipes based on available ingredients.

## Conclusion
TasteShare aims to create a unique, collaborative environment where cooking enthusiasts can find, adjust, and share recipes while connecting with a vibrant community. By empowering users with customizable recipes and interactive engagement, TasteShare will serve as a one-stop resource for those seeking culinary inspiration, support, and connection.
