## Discovering the Value of TypeScript
At the beginning of my second year of college, the pandemic hit, and I put my studies on hold to give birth. To stay engaged with my field, I began watching YouTube videos related to computer science to refresh my knowledge and keep up with industry trends. During this time, I often heard that TypeScript might not be the best choice for every project due to its added complexity, extra setup, and potential to slow down development.

In fact, I was both surprised and uncertain when my class announced that we would be working with TypeScript. This unexpected turn led me to reconsider my initial doubts. Working with TypeScript provided a hands-on opportunity to understand its advantages and challenges in a real-world context. I began to appreciate how TypeScript’s strict typing and enhanced tooling could contribute to more robust and maintainable code, despite its additional setup requirements. The initial learning curve and extra step were balanced by the increased clarity and error handling which proved beneficial in programming.

## Unveiled!
Through this experience, I learned the value of embracing new technologies and the importance of maintaining flexibility. Initially, I was hesitant about TypeScript, having heard mixed opinions and concerns about its complexity compared to JavaScript. However, diving into the language opened my eyes to its unique strengths. While every tool has its drawbacks, I found that TypeScript’s ability to catch errors early and enforce type safety allowed me to write cleaner, more reliable code. This benefit outweighed my initial concerns and reshaped my perspective on the language.

The process of learning TypeScript taught me that adapting to unfamiliar tools is a crucial skill in programming. In the fast-paced world of technology, new languages, frameworks, and tools are constantly emerging, each with its own advantages and limitations. The key isn’t to avoid new methods but to understand and adapt to them, identifying when they can help streamline workflows or improve the quality of code. My journey with TypeScript has shown me that remaining flexible and open to change is essential to growth as a developer.

More importantly, this experience reinforced my commitment to ongoing learning and adaptation in the ever-evolving field of computer science. Rather than sticking to what I know or shying away from new challenges, I now understand that each new tool, no matter how daunting at first, can offer valuable lessons and sharpen my skills. Balancing skepticism with a willingness to embrace new methods has become a cornerstone of my approach to programming, and it’s a mindset I carry forward as I continue my journey of growth in this dynamic field.
