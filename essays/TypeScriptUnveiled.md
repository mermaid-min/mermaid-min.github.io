At the beginning of my second year of college, the pandemic hit, and I put my studies on hold to give birth. To stay engaged with my field, I began watching YouTube videos related to computer science to refresh my knowledge and keep up with industry trends. During this time, I often heard that TypeScript might not be the best choice for every project due to its added complexity, extra setup, and potential to slow down development.

So, I was both surprised and uncertain when my class announced that we would be working with TypeScript. This unexpected turn led me to reconsider my initial doubts. Working with TypeScript provided a hands-on opportunity to understand its advantages and challenges in a real-world context. I began to appreciate how TypeScriptâ€™s strict typing and enhanced tooling could contribute to more robust and maintainable code, despite its additional setup requirements. The initial learning curve and extra step were balanced by the increased clarity and error handling which proved beneficial in programming.

Through this experience, I learned the value of embracing new technologies and the importance of maintaining flexibility. It highlights that while every tool has its drawbacks, understanding and adapting to them can lead to significant growth and improved programming practice. This journey with TypeScript has taught me how to balance skepticism with a willingness to embrace new methods, reinforcing my commitment to ongoing learning and adaptation in the ever-evolving field of computer science.
