## Overwhelmed
Starting my journey with Visual Studio Code (VSCode) and GitHub was both exciting and a bit overwhelming. As I explored the application, I had to get used to its many features and shortcuts, which felt a bit challenging at first. Each tool and setting seemed to come with its own difficulties, but I was determined to learn how everything worked. 

One of the biggest challenges I faced was using ESLint in my coding. At first, it was tough because I kept running into errors, leaving me unsure if I had everything set up correctly. Despite these challenges, I soon realized how helpful ESLint could be for my coding practice. It encouraged me to maintain a consistent coding style and taught me important best practices. Even something as simple as proper indentation became very significant. By organizing my code neatly, I found it easier to read and spot mistakes, which helped me understand my work better.

I also struggled a bit with the terminal, especially when it came to the commands npm and npx. At first, I found them confusing because I didn’t understand the difference between the two. npm, which stands for Node Package Manager, is used to install packages and manage dependencies for JavaScript projects. On the other hand, npx allows you to run packages without having to install them globally, making it easy to use tools straight from the command line. However, I learned that facing these difficulties was part of the learning journey. Each time I encountered a problem, it pushed me to learn more about the tools I was using, which helped me appreciate them even more.

## yet Excited!
Reflecting on my experience, I see that coding standards, often seen as small details, are very important in programming. They help write clear and organized code. Following these standards not only helps with individual projects but also makes it easier to work with other developers. After my first week with ESLint in VSCode, I can say that fixing ESLint errors has been both frustrating and useful. Even though it was challenging, I learned a lot and gained confidence in handling programming languages. I still struggle at times, but my excitement for coding continues to grow, and I’m excited to use these skills as I navigate the overwhelming yet thrilling journey of software engineering.
